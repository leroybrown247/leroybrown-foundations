    <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>
    <h2>The aim of this blog is to reflect on your core personal values, and your strengths and limitations.</h2>
    <h3>Sprint 1 - CORE - 07th of April 2023</h3>
    
    <h3>
    1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h3>

    <p>
        A few years ago I was offered seafood that was not sustainably harvested and did not meet best practices. This I felt may damage the environment or deplete resources. 
        I chose not to participate and voiced my opinion as I felt that my ethical beliefs along with traditional cultural practices would be compromised.
        <br>
        <br>
        Reflecting on this situation now I believe explaining my opinion gave those that harvested in this way were given a different perspective that changed 
        and helped them understand this point of view. In the end, they returned Kai Moana to where it came from. We later would become friends and often see each other's families when we can.
    </p>

    <h3>
    2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
    </h3>

    <p>
        Growing up in a small town with a large Māori population, I was immersed in Māori culture and customs from an early age. 
        My whānau (family) and wider community instilled in me the importance of whakapapa (genealogy) and knowing my roots, 
        as well as the value of kaitiakitanga (guardianship) and taking care of the environment and our resources.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I moved around and was exposed to different cultures and ways of life, I became more aware of the diversity and richness of the world around me. 
        I learned to appreciate and respect different cultures and traditions, while also staying true to my own cultural identity and values.
        My culture and the people around me have influenced my values and identity in many ways, including my strong sense of family and community, my respect for the environment and our resources.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, I believe that my cultural identity and values are a source of strength and resilience, and have helped me to navigate the complexities and challenges of life with grace and determination.    
    </p>

    <h3>
    3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
    </h3>

    <p>
        I feel that my strengths are adaptability, discipline, dedication and resilience. These traits will help me progress through my learning journey through the application of each task provided.
    </p>

    <h3>
    4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>

    <p>
        The limitations I believe that to have are my high self-expectations, these can limit learning in terms of not taking seriously healthy work habits. 
        Becoming distracted by unnecessary tasks and not paying attention to the overall task ahead of me.
        These may affect my journey by creating anxiety and unhealthy decisions that cause self-doubt leading to tasks not getting done.
    </p>

    <h3>
    5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
    Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
    </h3>

    <p>
        I was working in a team which who was responsible for designing an informational booklet. I encountered resistance from one of our teammates who was not invested in the project. 
        They were not participating in discussions or contributing to the work which was causing friction within our team.
        <br>
        <br>
        Communication is where I tend to begin with these situations as I may not be aware of this individual's personal situation. 
        In doing so I found out that they originally asked not to be a part of the project and felt forced into the situation leading them to feel unvalued by the over company. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My team navigated this by suggesting that the individual had the ability to contribute positively to this project and had skills that we felt we could maximise to a high potential. 
        By dividing up the work among team members in a way that takes into account each person's strengths and interests. This can help to ensure that everyone is engaged and contributing in a meaningful way. This led to the whole team feeling valued and empowered to contribute.
        <br>
        <br>
        In reflection, I believe that communicating with the individual allowed them to self-reflect. 
        Then delegating tasks that would not only provide contribution and small steps to collaboration helped build confidence in themselves and in the team dynamic. 
        Also providing feedback and checking in with the team would always produce clarity and keep each other engaged in a more meaningful way with each other and the tasks we individually had.
