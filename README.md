<strong>I am a digital design and technology enthusiast based in Auckland.</strong>  I bring a unique blend of strategic thinking and creative flair to my work, and I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible.

My passion for technology led me to Dev Academy, where I'm currently honing my coding skills and absorbing as much knowledge as possible. I'm constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to expand my skillset, and I'm determined to use technology to create innovative solutions that improve people's lives.

### Code snippets and coding concepts I enjoyed and feel proud of. 

##### *09/04/23*

<br>

1. My first **blog post container**. I am proud of this particular snippet of code because it allowed me to give access to my blog page from my home page. This was important for me because after a few design iterations I felt that having a single page for now would make access to my blog posts alot easier for the user.

2. I also used my first **image upload** here which took some finessing as the original aspect ratio for my asthetic was way out of proportion to strart with. Playing around with different iamges and aspect ratios I eventually found a size that I was pleased with.

#### HTML

```sh

Blog post container

    <div class="blogs-container">
    <!-- Blog post 1 -->
      <div class="blog-box">
       <img src="./blog/Background_1.png" class="blog-box-img">
       <h2> HTML-CSS</h2>
       <div class="div.absolute">
         <p class="tag core-tag">Sprint 2 - TECH</p>
       </div>
       <p class="blog-box-text">What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</p>
       <a href="blog/html-css.html">READ MORE â†’</a>
      </div>

```

<br>

3. The most exciting part for me was actually creating a **READ MORE** button with a hover state that I could stylise.

<br>

#### CSS

```sh

.blog-box a:hover {
    color: #fff;
    background-color: #000;
    text-decoration: underline;

```
