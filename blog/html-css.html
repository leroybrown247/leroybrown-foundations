    <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
    <h3>Sprint 2 - tech - 07th of April 2023</h3>
    
    <p>
        When we use an ID, we're basically giving a specific element a unique identifier, so that we can style or manipulate it in some way. IDs are great when we're dealing with just one element that needs to be styled or manipulated.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, when we use a class, we're basically giving a name to a group of elements that we want to style or manipulate in the same way. This saves us from having to repeat code over and over again, and makes it easier to manage our styles.
    </p>

    <p>It's generally not recommended to use IDs for styling purposes, as this can make our code harder to maintain in the long run. Instead, it's better to use IDs for things like JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we're naming our classes and IDs, it's important to use descriptive names that make it clear what the element is being used for. We should also avoid using too many classes on a single element, as this can make our code harder to read and understand.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, it's important to use consistent naming conventions throughout our project, to make it easier to manage our code and to avoid confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, to sum up: IDs are great for unique elements, while classes are great for groups of elements that we want to style or manipulate in the same way. Use descriptive names, avoid using too many classes, and keep your naming conventions consistent throughout your project. Happy coding!
