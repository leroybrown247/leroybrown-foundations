    <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity helps us understand the brain and implement strategies 
        that allow us to change and adapt and learn new skills.
      </p>
  </article>

    <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Focus on deliberate practice:</strong> When it comes to coding, it's important to break down concepts into smaller 
        parts and practice them regularly. This helps our brains learn and form new pathways. I reckon if I do this, 
        coding will become easier over time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mental visualization:</strong> Sometimes it's hard to wrap my head around code 
        blocks and the flow of a program. But I can use mental imagery to help me understand these concepts better. 
        By picturing them in my mind, I can improve my memory retention too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mindfulness:</strong> I've found that mindfulness really helps me stay focused while coding. It's all about being present in 
        the moment and concentrating on the task at hand. By doing this, I can block out distractions and get more done.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive self-talk:</strong> As a beginner coder, it can be frustrating when things don't work out. But I'm learning to use 
        positive self-talk to stay motivated and focused. I try to remind myself of the progress I've made and the things 
        I've accomplished so far. That way, I can keep moving forward and get better at coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, by using these principles and strategies of neuroplasticity, I believe I can become a better coder. 
        With practice, mental visualization, mindfulness, and positive self-talk, I can improve my skills and achieve my coding goals.

    <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?:</h2>
      <p>
        Practising mindfulness, a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, exercising and engaging in challenging mental tasks.

    <h2>Growth Mindset, Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:</h2>
      <p>
        The growth mindset is a way of thinking that suggests that our intelligence, talents, and abilities can be developed 
        through hard work, dedication, and perseverance. This is different from a fixed mindset, which suggests that our abilities 
        and talents are predetermined and can't be changed.
      </p>
      <p>  
        This is relevant because we can use this information to understand that by believing that we can develop skills 
        and abilities, we can embrace challenges, persist through setbacks and learn from failures.
      </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?:</h2>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is something I am familiar with from doing martial arts in my younger years. What I do find surprising is 
        how often I need to recalibrate this concept in my own mind every now and again. This is often due to things like the challenge 
        at the moment may seem impossible, but this is where you start applying mindfulness practices and understanding that there there is a balance.
      </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?:</h2>
    <p>
      Once you start recognising that challenges are opportunities for personal growth you can start embracing them from a positive perspective.
      So Instead of avoiding failure, I will see it as an opportunity to learn and improve.
