    <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS:</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        Kia ora! You might be curious about how JavaScript, HTML, and CSS work together to create beautiful and interactive websites. 
        Let's break it down using one of my favourite takeout options “Fish and Chips”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay so let's say you're building a website for a classic New Zealand fish and chips shop. To create this website, 
        you'll need three key components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Javascript-dom images/Fish-and-chips-3-(1).png">
        </figure>
      <p> 
        <strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is like the foundation and structure of your fish and chips shop. 
        It defines the layout and content of your website, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. 
        For example, you might use HTML to create a header that says "Kia ora, welcome to our Kiwi Fish and Chips!" 
        and to add a menu with the various items available for order.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is like the paint and decorations of your fish and chips shop. 
        It controls the appearance and styling of your website, such as colors, fonts, and spacing. 
        With CSS, you can design the website to reflect the classic New Zealand vibe, perhaps by using the colors 
        of the Kiwi flag (blue, red, and white) or featuring images of iconic NZ landscapes in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>JavaScript</strong> is like the friendly staff at your fish and chips shop who make everything run smoothly. 
        It's a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic content to your website. For example, 
        you could use JavaScript to create an interactive menu that shows more information about each dish when a 
        user hovers over it, or to add a form that lets customers place an order directly from the website.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>In summary, HTML provides the structure and content of your website, CSS determines its appearance, 
        and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic elements.</strong> Together, these three technologies work hand-in-hand 
        to create a unique and engaging experience for visitors to your fish and chips shop website. 
        Happy coding, and kia kaha!
      </p>

    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life:</h2>

      <p>
      <strong>Kia ora!</strong> Let's explain control flow and loops using the example of making a flat white coffee, my favourite morning beverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow refers to the order in which a program's instructions are executed. Conditional statements (like if-else) 
        and loops (like for and while) are used to control this flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you want to make a flat white coffee for yourself and two friends, and you have enough milk and coffee beans.
        Here's how control flow and loops might apply:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Check if the coffee machine is ready to use with a conditional statement:
      </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Javascript-dom images/JS 1 (1).png">
        </figure>
      <p>
        2. If the coffee machine is ready, use a loop to make three flat white coffees:
      </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Javascript-dom images/JS 2 (1).png">
        </figure>
      <p>
        In this example, we've used conditional statements and loops to control the flow of making flat white coffees. 
        This demonstrates how programming concepts can be applied to everyday life in a simplified and familiar context. 
        Happy coding, and enjoy your delicious flat whites!
      </p>

    <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:</h2>

      <p>
        Let us say you're making a flat white coffee, in your cafe kitchen. In this scenario, your coffee (the flat white) 
        represents your website, the main ingredients (milk, coffee beans) are your HTML, the spices and extra ingredients 
        (sugar, cocoa powder) are your CSS, and the utensils and cookware (coffee machine, milk frother) are your JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's introduce the DOM. In this analogy, the DOM would be your cafe kitchen itself. It provides the space 
        and tools that allow you to create and modify your coffee (the flat white). It's where you can access all the ingredients, 
        utensils, and cookware to make adjustments and improvements to your creation.
      </p>
      <p>    
        When interacting with the DOM, you're working in your kitchen to adjust the ingredients (HTML), spices (CSS), 
        and using the utensils (JavaScript) to create your perfect flat white.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For example, you might use the DOM to:</strong>
      </p>  
      <p>
        - Change the main ingredient (HTML) by switching the type of coffee bean.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Add extra spices or ingredients (CSS) by sprinkling cocoa powder on top of the flat white.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Use utensils (JavaScript) to froth the milk and create the ideal milk-to-espresso ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
        - If something goes wrong, you can use the DOM (kitchen) to start over, adjust the recipe, or fix any issues.
      </p>
      <p>     
        In summary, the DOM is like your cafe kitchen, providing access to the tools and space necessary to create and manipulate 
        your dish (website) using HTML (main ingredients), CSS (spices and extra ingredients), and JavaScript (utensils and cookware).
      </p>

        <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</h2>

      <p>
        Let's use a fish and chip shop analogy to explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of an array as a queue of customers waiting to order fish and chips. Each customer is in a specific position (index)
        in the queue:
      </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Javascript-dom images/Arrays and Objects 1 (1).png">
        </figure>
      <p>
        To find out who's in a certain position, you'd use their index in the queue (starting from 0):
      </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Javascript-dom images/Arrays and Objects 2 (1).png">
        </figure>
      <p>
        An object, on the other hand, is like the menu at the fish and chip shop, with items and their prices:
      </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Javascript-dom images/Arrays and Objects 3 (1).png">
        </figure>
      <p>
        To find the price of an item, you'd use the item's name (key):
      </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Javascript-dom images/Arrays and Objects 4 (1).png">
        </figure>
      <p>
        In summary, arrays are like customer queues, where you access elements using their position (index), 
        while objects are like menus, where you access elements using their name (key).
      </p>

    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful:</h2>

      <p>
        Let's talk Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, helping you organize your code, 
        reduce repetition, and simplify maintenance.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Imagine you're making an app for a New Zealand café to calculate the cost of a flat white order. You can create a function 
        called ‘calculateFlatWhiteCost’:
      </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Javascript-dom images/Functions 1 (1).png">
        </figure>
      <p>    
        Now, you can use this function to easily calculate the cost of any flat white order:
      </p>
        <figure>    
          <img src="Javascript-dom images/Functions 2 (1).png">
        </figure>
      <p> 
        Functions like calculateFlatWhiteCost make your code more efficient and easier to manage by allowing you to reuse 
        and update it effortlessly.
