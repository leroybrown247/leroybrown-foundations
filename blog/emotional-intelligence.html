        1. What is Emotional Intelligence?    
    </h3>
    <p>
        Emotional Intelligence, or EI, is the ability to understand and manage emotions, both in yourself and others. 
        It involves being aware of your own feelings and being able to regulate them, as well as being able to understand 
        and respond appropriately to the emotions of those around you.

        There are five key components of EI: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. 
        Self-awareness means being able to recognize and understand your own emotions. Self-regulation is the ability to control 
        your emotions and behaviors, even in difficult situations. Motivation involves being driven by personal goals and values. 
        Empathy is the ability to understand and relate to the feelings of others. Social skills include effective communication, 
        conflict resolution, and building and maintaining relationships.
        
        People with high emotional intelligence tend to have better relationships, both personal and professional. 
        They are better able to communicate effectively, understand others' perspectives, and manage conflict. 
        They may also experience better mental health and overall well-being.    
    </p>
    <h3>
        2. How is EQ different to IQ?
    </h3>
    <p>
        EQ, or Emotional Intelligence, is the ability to understand and manage emotions, both in yourself and others. 
        It involves being able to recognize and regulate your own emotions, as well as understanding and responding to the 
        emotions of those around you. EQ is focused on social and emotional skills, such as communication, empathy, and conflict resolution.

        IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a measure of intellectual ability, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and logical thinking. 
        IQ is typically measured through standardized tests and is often used as an indicator of academic success or job performance.
        
        The key difference between EQ and IQ is that EQ is focused on emotional and social skills, while IQ is focused on intellectual
        abilities. While both are important in personal and professional life, EQ is especially important in building and maintaining 
        relationships, managing emotions, and navigating social situations. In contrast, IQ is more relevant in academic and professional
         settings that require logical thinking and problem-solving.    
    </p>
    <h3>
        3. Why is EQ important?
    </h3>
    <p>
        EQ, or Emotional Intelligence, is important because it allows us to understand and manage our own emotions, as well as the emotions
        of those around us. This is particularly important in social situations, where we need to communicate effectively, 
        build and maintain relationships, and navigate conflicts.

        Having a high level of EQ can lead to greater success in personal and professional relationships. People with high EQ are able
         to communicate effectively, understand others' perspectives, and manage conflicts in a constructive way. 
         This can lead to more positive and productive relationships, which can ultimately improve our overall well-being and mental health.
