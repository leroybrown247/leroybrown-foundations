    <h2>1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong><em>1.1 The ego is something to constantly be aware of.</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>  
        <strong>1.2 Collaboration requires we keep our ego in line in order to work well together.</strong>
      </p>  
      <p>  
        <strong>1.3 Don't let our pride get in the way of the learning process.</strong>      
    </p>

    <h2>2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?:</h2>
      <p>  
        <strong><EM>I understand that values, empathy, and self-awareness are all crucial in the learning process to code or programme.</EM></strong> 
        By understanding my own values and being empathetic towards others, I can develop software that is user-friendly and creates a positive 
        experience for the users. Self-awareness is also important as it helps me recognise my strengths and weaknesses. 
        This allows me to take on projects that allow me to improve while also leveraging my skills. Through the improvement and practising 
        these values, I hope to become a better programmer and create software that has a positive impact.

    <h2>3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong><em>How much of a positive impact it would have on my personal mindset.</em></strong> I say this because I find it refreshing that an industry that is often 
        traditionally viewed as very technical and cold is actually built upon community and people.
      </p>

    <h2>4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Probably timing and the human element.</em></strong> So to elaborate I was quite sick some days so lining up a good time to meet proved challenging 
        at times. Although getting over my personal "whakamā" or shame in terms of making myself vulnerable by exposing my coding skills or unfinished projects to others
        was also a bit of a challenge.

    <h2>5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?:</h2>
      <p>
        I feel like it is because it is a lot more people-orientated than what people expect out there in the workforce. 
        So reinforcing this fact proves to be important for employers. 
      </p>

    <h2>6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer?:</h2>
      <p>
        The time spent studying core learning here was not a waste of time because it allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles 
        of what makes a good programmer both individually and within a team environment. This understanding has helped me to approach programming problems with more confidence 
        and provided me with the necessary skills to practice efficient and effective code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, understanding concepts like values, empathy, and self-awareness can lead to better communication and teamwork skills, which are crucial in the workplace. 
        By learning how to work well with others, I can collaborate with other individuals and share knowledge, leading to better outcomes for the team as a whole. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The time spent studying core learning concepts was not a waste of time. It has provided me with a strong foundation to start from and helped me to develop better 
        communication and teamwork skills, which are essential for success in any industry.
