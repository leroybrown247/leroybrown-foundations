    <h3>Sprint 2 - CORE</h3>
    <time datetime="07-04-2023">07th of April 2023</time>
    
    <article>
    <h3>1. What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>

      <p>
        In terms of long-term goals, I hope to attain enough skills and knowledge to enter a career as a web developer. 
        In terms of specialisation, I wish to explore this while studying at Dev Academy.
      </p>

    <h3>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>

      <p>
        My strengths when it comes to learning include my ability to adapt quickly, discipline and dedication to whatever I set my mind to. 
        I have also learned over time that I learn more efficiently when I give myself permission to step away from a task and self-reflect, 
        returning to the task with a fresh perspective and clear mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The limitations I recognise would be my high self-expectations. 
        I can often get tunnel vision and get deep into a subject without considering its importance in the broader context.
      </p>

    <h3>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

      <p>
        Collaborative growth mindset. I would like to grow and progress alongside others just like myself. I feel that the only 
        way to do so is to be a part of the community and learn from each other.
      </p>

    <h3> 4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>

      <p>
        <em> 
        Explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators 
        and industry/community representatives.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of time management, I have set aside specific times for studying based on the curriculum provided. 
        In saying that I have also provided myself with some extra time every day to explore any content that I may have had 
        trouble with or to actually practice and develop my coding skills. I will also evaluate the tools and suggestions 
        provided by Dev and improve on these aspects when and where possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</em>
      </p>  
      <p>
        Self-care I believe to be important and to take care of ones self physically and mentally by getting enough sleep, 
        eating well, and engaging in activities that help me to relax and de-stress.Seek support and reach out to facilitators 
        or peers for help or guidance. They may have suggestions or resources that can help to better manage workload and stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seek support and reach out to facilitators or peers for help or guidance. They may have suggestions or resources that can 
        help to better manage workload and stress.
      </p>

    <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>

      <p>
        At this point, Discord seems to be the most efficient way of asking for and getting help in a timely manner. 
        I will use this for now but will definitely lean on my facilitators whenever needed.
      </p>

    <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
    
      <p>
        To provide help and support when and where ever needed. To also provide reviews of our work with any recommendations 
        or insights for the future.
      </p>

    <h3>
        7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have 
        whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
        
    <p>
        I do not have these at the moment but am aware that things may change in the future. I am currently well supported in my 
        studies with Dev Academy by my partner, whanau and friends.I generally block out time for self-care and reflection outside of my study hours.
