    <h3>Sprint 5 - CORE</h3>
    <time datetime="30-04-2023">30th of April 2023</time>

    <article>
      <h3>1. What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
  
        <p>
          In terms of long-term goals not much has changed from Sprint-2, I still hope to attain enough skills and knowledge to enter a career 
          as a web developer. In terms of specialisation, I wish to explore this while studying at Dev Academy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, I hope to make a positive impact on people's lives through the software I develop. Whether it's by creating innovative solutions 
          to real-world problems or by improving the user experience of existing products, I want to be able to use my skills to make a meaningful difference. 
          While I don't have a specific destination in mind, I am committed to continually learning and growing in this field to achieve my long-term goals.
        </p>

        <h3>2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
  
        <p>
          I believe that my strengths in research, strategy, and communication will be valuable during Bootcamp, while my limitations in time management 
          and debugging skills will be areas for improvement. By focusing on improving these skills and building on my strengths, I am confident that I can 
          overcome any challenges that come my way during Bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h3>3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
  
        <p>
          One challenge that I anticipate is time management. While I am eager to learn as much as possible during Bootcamp, I recognize the importance of 
          balancing my workload and avoiding burnout. I plan to approach this challenge by creating a realistic schedule that includes dedicated time for learning, 
          practice, and relaxation. By setting achievable goals and prioritising my workload, I believe that I can manage my time effectively and maximise 
          my learning opportunities during Bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h3>4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
  
        <p>
          I would like to develop my pairing with others and communicate effectively and efficiently within my pairing.
        </p>

        <h3>5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
  
        <p>
          In terms of support, I would like creative and constructive criticism. Understanding where I can improve is always important to me.
        </p>

        <h3>6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
  
        <p>
          My personal expectations for Bootcamp include gaining a comprehensive understanding of the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the industry, 
          building strong connections with my peers and facilitators, and ensuring that the experience is both enjoyable and productive for everyone involved.
        </p>

        <p>
          To achieve these goals, I recognise the importance of seeking help when needed. I plan to seek help from my peers and facilitators during class time 
          and work collaboratively with my team members during group projects. Additionally, I will make use of online resources and tutorials to supplement my 
          learning and deepen my understanding of complex topics.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of managing my workload, I commit to being disciplined and strategic in my approach. This includes prioritising my tasks, setting achievable goals,
          and working steadily to complete all tasks within the given timeframe. I will also make time for self-care and self-reflection, recognising the importance of
          maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, I understand that working productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives is essential for a 
          positive experience. To ensure this, I will actively communicate with my team members, participate in group discussions and activities, and be respectful 
          and considerate towards others. By working together and supporting each other, I believe that we can all achieve our goals and have a productive and enjoyable 
          experience during Bootcamp.

    <h3>1. What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>

      <p>
        In terms of long-term goals, I hope to attain enough skills and knowledge to enter a career as a web developer. 
        In terms of specialisation, I wish to explore this while studying at Dev Academy.
      </p>

    <h3>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>

      <p>
        My strengths when it comes to learning include my ability to adapt quickly, discipline and dedication to whatever I set my mind to. 
        I have also learned over time that I learn more efficiently when I give myself permission to step away from a task and self-reflect, 
        returning to the task with a fresh perspective and clear mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The limitations I recognise would be my high self-expectations. 
        I can often get tunnel vision and get deep into a subject without considering its importance in the broader context.
      </p>

    <h3>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

      <p>
        Collaborative growth mindset. I would like to grow and progress alongside others just like myself. I feel that the only 
        way to do so is to be a part of the community and learn from each other.
      </p>

    <h3> 4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>

      <p>
        <em> 
        Explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators 
        and industry/community representatives.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of time management, I have set aside specific times for studying based on the curriculum provided. 
        In saying that I have also provided myself with some extra time every day to explore any content that I may have had 
        trouble with or to actually practice and develop my coding skills. I will also evaluate the tools and suggestions 
        provided by Dev and improve on these aspects when and where possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</em>
      </p>  
      <p>
        Self-care I believe to be important and to take care of ones self physically and mentally by getting enough sleep, 
        eating well, and engaging in activities that help me to relax and de-stress.Seek support and reach out to facilitators 
        or peers for help or guidance. They may have suggestions or resources that can help to better manage workload and stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seek support and reach out to facilitators or peers for help or guidance. They may have suggestions or resources that can 
        help to better manage workload and stress.
      </p>

    <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>

      <p>
        At this point, Discord seems to be the most efficient way of asking for and getting help in a timely manner. 
        I will use this for now but will definitely lean on my facilitators whenever needed.
      </p>

    <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
    
      <p>
        To provide help and support when and where ever needed. To also provide reviews of our work with any recommendations 
        or insights for the future.
      </p>

    <h3>
        7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have 
        whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
        
    <p>
        I do not have these at the moment but am aware that things may change in the future. I am currently well supported in my 
        studies with Dev Academy by my partner, whanau and friends.I generally block out time for self-care and reflection outside of my study hours.
