      <h2>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong><em>In the deBee.js file in the 5-builtin-methods,</em></strong>  
        I struggled to understand how to use the 'split' method properly at first. I had a syntax error using 
        curly brackets ('{}') instead of a space (' '), which was demoralising. I took a break and drank some 
        water before moving on to the next issue, which was using the filter method correctly. I found a helpful 
        resource on the JavaScript Array filter() method, which showed me where I was going wrong. It turned out 
        to be another syntax error.
      </p>
    </article>

      <h2>2. Elegantly solved a problem:</h2>
      <p>  
        In the same deBee.js in the 5-builtin-methods I found that filtering out all the words containing the 
        substring "buzz", ignoring the case, using the filter method. The test is performed using a regular expression 
        (/buzz/i) which is case-insensitive due to the "i" flag.
        I saw a similar case in a freecodecamp tutorial and thought it maybe clever to use it here.

      <h2>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I feel average in using this method. I am however trying to apply it daily as I do find it 
        helpful to write things down in steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Trying something:</strong> Confident although I am not sure how successful I am in using it. 
        I often use this method when I just need to get started or to get over a hump.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> Confident as I am usually talking to myself or putting each task into 
        a little jingle which I sing to myself anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> I feel average in this area as I am sure there is still a lot to Z
        learn in this area. But I have been successful when I have used it in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Console.logging:</strong> Confident although I feel like I can improve by just remembering to use it 
        and checking back.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Googling:</strong> Very confident, I considered this a super skill in my previous employment and have 
        brought that skill with me to Dev.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> Again very confident asking my peers for help when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> Confident although I have not run into an issue where I have had 
        to come directly to my coaches so far. Although I do dig deep into the material provided and attend all of 
        the tutorials provided to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> I am confident that my process is improving due to 
        reflection. Taking the time to review the day/week helps me to solidify subjects in my mind. 
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so:</h2>
      <p>
      Sometimes I feel like my confidence in using digital resources can cause an obstacle. As there were moments 
      during the JS Kata where I am sure I could have solved an issue quicker if I had just gone and asked one of 
      my coaches. I guess I felt reluctant because of my pride and not wanting to allow myself to be defeated, silly 
      really. But I will sure to put my ego in check when I recognise I can do things faster by just asking a question.
